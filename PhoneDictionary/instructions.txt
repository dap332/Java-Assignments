Will take input from stdin.

enter a series of numbers and it will decode it to words that can be found in a word list file.

Just like on a 1-9 old fashioned phone dial, the letters come from the digits.

e.g. a 2 is 'A,a' or 'B,b' or 'C,c'
     a 3 is 'D,d' or 'E,e' or 'F,f' and so on.

	Think of a phone pad.

	a 0 or any amount of 0's is consider ONE space.

	a 1 is unknown

	If the numbers don't match a word, it will show '*' for the rest of the word. This also occurs one a 1

	Was not built to handle contractions and other certain symbols.

	If multiple words come from the same digits then all the options will be shown in paretheses separate by |'s

		e.g. 5683 would show up as (Jove|love|jove) because all those words are in the wordlist that have the same numeric encoding.

	The file words will have all a list of words that the program uses.

input one series of digits at a time and get the output.
press enter to input again.

Program ends on EOT character .


e.g.

004056830007764726077770

This will print

(g|h|i) (Jove|love|jove) program ****

Since there are multiple possible words for the first two sets of digits, and none for the last set.
